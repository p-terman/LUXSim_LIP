Macros_Readme.txt

The subdirectory IntroMacros2016 has eight new macros written in February of 2016 by Matthew Szydagis as starting places for new LUXSim users to become acquainted with its operation. 

IntroMacros2016/LUXDetectorNESTonPhotPropOff_FastSim.mac should be the most commonly referenced. It is the quickest starter macro that runs fast, produces data processable with the data processing framework and works for Run03 re-analysis.

Older macros have been removed at this time as they were out of date and misleading.
